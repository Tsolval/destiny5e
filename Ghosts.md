# [Ghosts](http://destiny-grimoire.info/#Card-103090)
_"In its dying breath, the Traveler created the Ghosts...To seek out those who can wield its Light as a weapon. Guardians, to protect us, and do what the Traveler itself no longer can."_
___
Built from machinery and the Traveler's Light, Ghosts guide their Guardian companions in the quest to reclaim our solar system.

Every Ghost seeks out its Guardian among the ancient dead. The Ghost serves as scout, librarian, and mechanic, waking ancient machinery and cracking alien codes. In the right situations, a Ghost can even save a Guardian from death.

But Ghosts are not immortal. As far as Guardians know, every loss is irreplaceable.

## Your Ghost
Your ghost brought you back from the dead.  It keeps you healthy and alive and tries to keep you in good humor as well.  When you face the darkness, your ghost lights your way and keeps you company, reminding you that you're never truly alone.  Without your ghost, you are little more than a zombie, slowly eating through the last of your stolen life.  And without a guardian, a ghost is not much more than a floating calculator.

Your character's ghost is a second, playable character that every guardian has tagging along with them.  While ghosts do not fight alongside you in the traditional sense, they perform a number of indispensable functions on the battlefield.  Each ghost takes its turn immediately after their guardian finishes a round and performs each of the following services.

### Light Collection
Your ghost is responsible for collecting and funneling to its guardian the fundamental source of their power, Light.  Every round, the ghost filters light from the environment, siphons it from dead enemies, and collects it from nearby Orbs dropped by other guardians.

Source | Amount | Circumstance
---|:---:|---
Environment  | 1d4 | Neither Ghost nor Guardian incapacitated
Orb of Light | 1d6 | Guardian passed within 5 feet of orb during the round
Normal Enemy | 1d4 | Guardian action resulted in enemy death
Major Enemy  | 1d6 | Guardian action resulted in enemy death
Elite Enemy  | 1d8 | Guardian action resulted in enemy death
Boss Enemy   | 1d10 | Guardian action resulted in enemy death

### Ammo Collection
Your ghost is responsible for restocking your ammo pouch.  As your guardian moves across the battlefield, your Ghost will collect any ammo packs within 5 feet and store them in your ammo pouch.

### Healing
Your ghost also provides for your health, but backlashes from being attacked complicate the process and prevent recovery.  If you are hurt, but haven't been injured in at least 5 rounds, your Ghost will start your healing, rolling a hit die for you at the end of every round and adding it back to your health pool.  Any ability or skill which reduces the recovery cooldown reduces the number of rounds between injury and recovery to a minimum of 1 round.

### Dying
If your guardian dies on the battlefield, your ghost goes into defensive mode, protecting your Light from consumption.  Once your allies have made the area safe, your ghost will resurrect you, giving you a single hitpoint, and begin your recovery the following round.

Given enough time, however, creatures of Darkness will consume the last reservoirs of your light.  If this happens, your guardian is dead and cannot be ressurrected.  Most ghosts would find the thought of abandoning their guardian abhorrent, at best.  But if circumstances somehow prevent your ghost from protecting you or is forced away, your ghost may survive your death.  If this happens, and the ghost doesn't self-destruct or wallow in despair, it may begin the search for another guardian.

## Dead Ghosts
> Battered and drained of their Light, these Ghosts are nevertheless valuable for the information they preserve. Their recovered memories may well prove vital to the City's survival.

> The problem of dead Ghosts troubles the City's scholars. Are new Ghosts still being born? Or is the number of Ghosts dwindling? Will there come a day when no more remain - an end to the rise of new Guardians?

> If that day is coming, then the City faces a desperate race against time to heal the Traveler before attrition takes its toll.

Ghosts almost invariably refuse to abandon their Guardians.  So when a guardian is killed in battle, the ghost become vulnerable.  Ghosts will be targeted and, if possible, destroyed by the enemy to keep the Guardians from rising again.  If the ghost cannot revive their host quickly enough then both Ghost and Guardian are doomed.

## Corrupted Ghosts
> Two more scans and she could move on to the elevated grid. There wasn't really anything new other than the delta to sea level, but at less than 30% of the way through 2^128 scans, even a distinction without a difference could feel like a brand new shell.

> "Cassiopeia!"

> So numb after months with just her own scans for company. She didn't even pick up on another Ghost being this close. "Obverse? Wait. I'm sorry. You're... Obsidian! Wow, how long has it been?"

> "Well, I mean..."

> "I know. It's been 6.8 years. It's just an expression."

> Obsidian floated closer. "That's okay. It HAS been a while. I guess you haven't found yours yet?"

> Cassiopeia projected glumness. "Not yet. But I haven't been looking on Mars for that long, at least! I'm optimistic."

> "You should be! I was just at the City last year. A lot more of us are starting to find our Guardians latelâ€” what's that?"

> Cassiopeia resolved to run a full-range self-diagnostic before the next grid. Two Ghosts within twenty meters and she didn't sense either one? Something was off.

> The new arrival chirped and spoke up. "Hello, you two! I'm glad ~identify(OBSIDIAN)~ to see a friendly face! I haven't been myself lately."

> Obsidian looked at Cassiopeia. He read as nervous. She probably did, too.

> "I was beneath the Blind Watch for a while. A long ~SIVA.MEM.GH404~ while. It was fun! There were puzzles. No one was alive down there, though."

> Cassiopeia's scan of the new Ghost returned nothing amiss. "Are you okay, friend?"

> "I'm great! Something got in me but the Light ~if (LIGHT) then WARNING~ burned it away. It's gone forever, now! ~consume: FAILURE replicate:FAILURE enhance:FAILURE~"

> There was silence for a full three seconds. Then Obsidian spoke up, his words coming quickly.

> "Well, great to see you again, Cassiopeia! Good luck!" He zipped away.

> Cassiopeia watched him disappear into the horizon. "TWO self-diagnostics," she muttered.

Several fragments of lore have been discovered which speak of corrupted ghosts.  These ghosts wander aimlessly, silently, "buzzing with some sort of corruption", and appear to be searching for something.  Other ghosts are frightened by their corrupted brethren, and neither they, nor the Speaker, nor the Warlocks understand the condition.
