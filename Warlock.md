>My name is Eriana-3, disciple of the Praxic Warlocks, marked by the Cormorant Seal. We came here under one banner, united in a host of thousands, to claim the Moon. But the battle goes against us. I have taken a prisoner and this is the record of its interrogation. If I transgress in your eyes I ask for your forgiveness.<br>
[sound of current or discharge]<br>
/Eriana. It responds to pain.<br>
It responds to the Light. Hurt it again. Monster, heed me. Who is your master with the sword?<br>
[static event]<br>
I can hear it. In my head. The swordbearer's name is CROTA. Record that.<br>
/Should I burn it again?<br>
No. I think you're only feeding it. I will touch its mind. Ghost - help.<br>
They call you Wizard. You must be ancient. I think you value power very much. Will you still be powerful without this piece of your mind?<br>
Tell me how to kill Crota.<br>
[static event]<br>
It showed me the battle. It showed me Wei Ning dead on Crota's blade. It showed me how Crota killed a Guardian with a screaming knife hammered out of his own Ghost.<br>
So I will take a piece of its mind, and ask again.<br>
Tell me how to kill Crota.<br>
[static event]<br>
Incredible. Where? Where is his throne? Where is the twilight world under the dead star eye?<br>
/Eriana there's word from the company in Mare Imbrium. Crota is upon them. Half a hundred dead. They need us.<br>
Tell me where! Tell me how! TELL ME!<br>
[static event]<br>
/Eriana what did it say - <br>
It showed me how it did this, just exactly this, to an Awoken man, the knives arranged by its will, like little silver ships, like Ghosts - <br>
It laughed at me. It said we were the same.<br>
/Crota marches with a thousand Knights and they say the sky above Mare Imbrium has turned into green fire. They are dying in numbers I cannot bear to repeat. He kills them one by one with a sword that eats their Light. Eriana, we have to do something - <br>
Kill the Wizard. Scatter the ash. It has nothing but lies to offer.<br>
Get your Sparrows. We have Light and fury. That will be enough<br>

## Class Features
### Arcane Optics
You have spent many hours researching the Travelers gift and have gained a few insights into the nature of Light which have allowed you to learn to manipulate it to your advantage.  At first level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the Warlock spell list at the bottom of this page.  You may learn additional cantrips at higher levels, as indicated in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.

### Awakened Mind
Starting at 1st level, your alien knowledge gives you the ability to touch the minds of other creatures.  You can telepathically speak to any creature you can see within 30 feet of you.  You don't need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language.

### Glide
At level two, you gain the Glide ability which allows you to use your light to slow your fall.  This can extend your long jump and high jump to twice your normal jump distance and also prevents damage from a fall much as the spell Feather Fall.  Depending on how this is used, this can extend either your long jump or your high jump as described below.

#### Long Jump
When you make a long jump with Glide, you can cover a number of feet up to twice your Wisdom score (not modifier) if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump.  A standing long jump covers only half that distance.  Each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of distance.

#### High Jump
When you make a high jump with Lift, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to (3 + willpower modifier) * 2 if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump.  A standing long jump covers only half this distance.  Each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.

At 5th level, your Glide ability gains one of the following features based on your selected Archetype.  Sunsingers and Stormcallers can choose between Focused Control, Focused Burst, and Balanced Glide.  Voidwalkers can choose between Focused Control, Focused Burst, and Blink.

Ability | Description | Bonus
---|---|---
Focused Control: | Upgrades Glide for better directional control while in mid-air. | You can now change direction up to 90 degrees in any direction once while in the middle of a jump.
Focused Burst: | Upgrades Glide to provide an initial burst of speed. | You cross the distance faster and gain an additional 5 feet of movement after a jump.
Balanced Glide: | Upgrades Glide to provide bonuses to both speed and control. | You cross the distance faster and gain an additional 5 feet of movement after a jump and you may alter your jump direction up to 45 degrees in any direction once while in the air.
Blink: | Teleport a short distance. | You teleport up to your maximum jump distance.  You cannot blink through solid obstacles, but it can be used to avoid traps, difficult terrain, etc.

### Light Pools
At level 2, you gain access to three pools of light. One supplies power to your special Melee attacks, one empowers your Grenades, and one is used for your Super. All pools start at 0 light. The melee pool has a maximum of 20 light points, the grenade pool max is 30, and the pool empowering your super maxes at 50 points. The ghost distills light from the environment, enemies you've destroyed, and Orbs of Light during the ghost round. See the section on Ghosts for more information.

### Melee
At level two, you gain access to a special light-enhanced, close-quarters, hand-to-hand melee attack. When you make a normal melee attack, you add your strength modifier and proficiency bonus to the roll to hit and do 1 + your strength modifier in damage.  If you consume 20 light from your Melee resource pool to upgrade this attack, you now add your wisdom modifier and proficiency bonus to the attack roll (instead of strength) and damage is 1d6 + wisdom modifier + proficiency bonus.

At 5th level, your melee will gain a feature based on your chosen Archetype. See the archetype section for options.

### Grenade
At level two, you gain access to a special light-powered grenade. These grenades consume 30 light from your Grenade resource pool. When you want to use a grenade, spend the light points and throw the grenade to any location within 60 feet.  The grenade will explode immediately, doing 3d6 Light damage to all enemies within 10 feet.  If the creature succeeds at a Dexterity save at DC 15, it will take half damage (round down).

At 3rd and 5th level, your grenade is affected by your chosen Archetype. See the archetype section for details.

### Traveller's Gift
## Warlock Archetypes
### [Voidwalker](http://destiny-grimoire.info/#Card-307060)
_"Those who have stared into the Void are not bound by the laws of space and time."_
The Traveler came out of the void that surrounds all things. Thus we know that the void is full of power. Thus we enter the void without fear.

Small minds will call your abilities blasphemous. They will compare you to the abominable Wizards of the Hive.

But you will not be held back. Gifted with the Traveler's Light, armed with the secret physics of a lost age, you will tear reality asunder.

You will fear nothing, and nothing will not fear you.
#### Super Ability - [Nova Bomb](http://destiny-grimoire.info/#Card-301160)
Channel the Traveler's Light into a bolt of energy with the power of a collapsing star. The devastating Nova Bomb scours the battlefield with ethereal fire - but be careful in its use. It takes precious moments to summon, and it must be aimed precisely to avoid obstacles.
#### Energy Drain
#### Void Grenades

### [Sunsinger](http://destiny-grimoire.info/#Card-307070)
_"There are flames that even the Darkness cannot extinguish."_
These are dark times. Humanity stands on the brink of extinction. We will carry fire into that darkness - a beacon to guide the way, and a pyre to consume our great enemy. 

The Light saved us from death and forged us into weapons. We seek to understand it, to embrace it, to consume and be consumed by it. We hope to become radiant.

Our fellow Guardians need our power. Our civilization needs our strength.
#### Super Ability - [Radiance](http://destiny-grimoire.info/#Card-301170)
Open yourself to the Light. Glimpse, for a few rapturous moments, the truth beyond the powers you wield.

A Warlock in a state of Radiance threatens to slip beyond the bonds of the material, shrugging off physical harm, channeling a torrent of abilities. Some may learn to elevate nearby Guardians, gifting them with power. Others, entranced by the Ghosts' power to reach beyond death, may learn to pluck themselves out of nothingness like the phoenix of ancient myth.
#### Scorch
#### Solar Grenades
#### Additional Features
### [Stormcaller](http://destiny-grimoire.info/#Card-700060)
“Harmony within, hurricane without.”
Meditate. Focus. Draw the static from within. The Arc is inside all life.

You must feel it take hold, let it flow through, but not consume you. You are a conduit. Between sky and earth. Electricity and matter. Life and death.

You are a weapon.
#### Super Ability - [Storm Trance](http://destiny-grimoire.info/#Card-700120)
Focus your Light to call forth a powerful Arc storm, and siphon it, channeling lightning through your fingertips to send it surging between your targets. A Warlock in Stormtrance is exercising such unbreakable focus that the Arc energy they summon draws them off the ground, the air humming and crackling around them. Like lightning you bend your path forward through the air, striking down anything too slow escape the storm.
#### Thunderstrike
#### Arc Grenades
