>My name is Eriana-3, disciple of the Praxic Warlocks, marked by the Cormorant Seal. We came here under one banner, united in a host of thousands, to claim the Moon. But the battle goes against us. I have taken a prisoner and this is the record of its interrogation. If I transgress in your eyes I ask for your forgiveness.<br>
[sound of current or discharge]<br>
/Eriana. It responds to pain.<br>
It responds to the Light. Hurt it again. Monster, heed me. Who is your master with the sword?<br>
[static event]<br>
I can hear it. In my head. The swordbearer's name is CROTA. Record that.<br>
/Should I burn it again?<br>
No. I think you're only feeding it. I will touch its mind. Ghost - help.<br>
They call you Wizard. You must be ancient. I think you value power very much. Will you still be powerful without this piece of your mind?<br>
Tell me how to kill Crota.<br>
[static event]<br>
It showed me the battle. It showed me Wei Ning dead on Crota's blade. It showed me how Crota killed a Guardian with a screaming knife hammered out of his own Ghost.<br>
So I will take a piece of its mind, and ask again.<br>
Tell me how to kill Crota.<br>
[static event]<br>
Incredible. Where? Where is his throne? Where is the twilight world under the dead star eye?<br>
/Eriana there's word from the company in Mare Imbrium. Crota is upon them. Half a hundred dead. They need us.<br>
Tell me where! Tell me how! TELL ME!<br>
[static event]<br>
/Eriana what did it say - <br>
It showed me how it did this, just exactly this, to an Awoken man, the knives arranged by its will, like little silver ships, like Ghosts - <br>
It laughed at me. It said we were the same.<br>
/Crota marches with a thousand Knights and they say the sky above Mare Imbrium has turned into green fire. They are dying in numbers I cannot bear to repeat. He kills them one by one with a sword that eats their Light. Eriana, we have to do something - <br>
Kill the Wizard. Scatter the ash. It has nothing but lies to offer.<br>
Get your Sparrows. We have Light and fury. That will be enough<br>

You have spent many hours researching the Travelers gift and have gained a few insights into the nature of Light which have allowed you to learn to manipulate it to your advantage.  At first level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the Traditional Warlock spell list at the bottom of this page.  You may learn additional cantrips at higher levels, as indicated in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.

### Awakened Mind
Starting at 1st level, your alien knowledge gives you the ability to touch the minds of other creatures.  You can telepathically speak to any creature you can see within 30 feet of you.  You don't need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language.

### Glide
At level two, you gain the Glide ability which allows you to use your light to neutralize your own gravity.  This can extend your long jump and high jump to twice your normal jump distance and also prevents damage from falling.  Depending on how it is used, Glide can extend either your long jump or your high jump as described below.

#### Long Jump
When you make a long jump with Glide, you can cover a number of feet up to twice your Wisdom score (not modifier) if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump.  A standing long jump covers only half that distance.  Each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of distance.

#### High Jump
When you make a high jump with Lift, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to (3 + willpower modifier) * 2 if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump.  A standing long jump covers only half this distance.  Each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.

At 5th level, your Glide ability gains one of the following features based on your selected Archetype.  Sunsingers and Stormcallers can choose between Focused Control, Focused Burst, and Balanced Glide.  Voidwalkers can choose between Focused Control, Focused Burst, and Blink.

Focused Burst: | Upgrades Glide to provide an initial burst of speed. | Your long jump takes you 10 feet further and your high jump takes you 5 feet higher over the non-upgraded Glide.
Balanced Glide: | Upgrades Glide to provide bonuses to both speed and control. | Your long jump and high jump take you 5 feet further than non-upgraded Glide and you may alter your jump direction up to 45 degrees in any direction once while in the air.
Blink: | Teleport a short distance. | You teleport up to your maximum Glide distance.  You cannot blink through solid obstacles, and you have to be able to see where you are going, but you can Blink over traps, difficult terrain, etc.

### Light Pools
At level 2, you gain access to three pools of Light. One supplies power to your special Melee attacks, one empowers your Grenades, and one is used for your Super Ability. All pools start at 0 Light. The Melee pool has a maximum of 20 Light points, the Grenade pool max is 30, and the pool empowering your Super Ability maxes at 50 points. During its round, Your ghost distills Light from the environment, enemies you've destroyed, and Orbs of Light you've encountered, and distributes it to your resource pools. See the section on Ghosts for more information.

### Melee - [Palm](http://destiny-grimoire.info/#Card-301200)

You can use this attack on any enemy within 5 feet to deal 1d6 damage.  Add your Wisdom modifier and Proficiency bonus to both the attack and damage rolls.

At 5th level, your melee will gain a feature based on your chosen Archetype. See the archetype section for options.

At 6th level, you learn to magically ward yourself against attack and to turn an enemy’s failed strike into good luck for yourself. When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on that roll. If the attack misses you, your next attack roll against the creature has advantage if you make it before the end of your next turn. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Traveller's Gift
The Traveler, via the Speaker, has gifted you with a repository of knowledge to aid you in your arcane endeavors. Your ghost provides you with direct access to this knowledge.  When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class's spell list (the three needn't be from the same list). So long as your ghost is near, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don't count against your number of cantrips known. If they don't appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you.
