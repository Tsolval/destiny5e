> I was nothingness. If I existed before, I existed as possibility, as potential, stretched thin across the aether. And maybe there was a body that looked like my body, complete with a soul that could be confused for someone rather like me. What I am now was not yet real. And then I was born, and the universe was free to begin.
> Others were present at my birth.
> A great ceremony had just begun. Because newborns are selfish beasts, I assumed I was the object of attention.
> I didn't notice the singing until the singers fell silent. And then She appeared.
> She was above me. Ethereal and handsome and elegant. I assumed my face was like her face and that odd idea gave me strength enough to smile.
> "Secrets," she said. "Creation is built on secrets and the encryptions that keep those secrets safe."
> I made my first sound. It meant nothing but she understood it as a question.
> "We are a beautiful creation," she said. "And we must keep ourselves very safe."

_"The others sing this song of Light and Dark. We, together, have transcended such unimaginative limitations."_
___
It is said that the Awoken were born in the Collapse, descended from those who tried to flee its wrath. Something happened to them out on the edge of the deep black, and they were forever changed.  Today many Awoken live in the distant Reef, aloof and mysterious. But others returned to Earth, where their descendants now fight for the City.  Earth-born Awoken who venture out to the Reef, hoping to learn its secrets, find no special welcome from the reclusive Queen.

Awoken are standoffish and resemble baseline humans, with the notable exception of having pale blue or gray skin. They also have luminescent eyes with glowing irises.  Beyond physical appearances, the Awoken seem to possess powers and abilities beyond their human ancestors. The Techeuns are a particularly notable example, though ordinary Awoken can also experience visions in the form of dreams.

**Ability Score Increase:** Your Dexterity, Wisdom, and Charisma scores each increase by 2.
**Age:** It is known that the average Awoken lives longer than the average Human.  But how much longer?  At what age is an Awoken youngster considered an adult? How long do Awoken live? Do Awoken born on the Reef live longer than those born on Earth? If anyone knows the answer to these questions, they aren't talking. But it doesn't matter. You're a Guardian. You're in no danger of dying so long as your Light is strong and you have your ghost. You do know where your ghost is right now, right?
**Alignment:** The Awoken society is based on reaching out and taking what they need to survive. They scavenge and trade and fight for food, clothing, shelter, wealth, and power both for themselves and for their people. Though they are generally a good people, they simply don't respect any law except the law of strength. Most Awoken are Chaotic Neutral.
