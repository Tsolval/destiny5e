_"Legends are carved across history by the brave."_

---

Guardians are warriors forged in the Traveler's Light, a final hope in a universe falling into Darkness.

Chosen from the dead by the Traveler's Ghosts, Guardians are those rare few able to wield the Light as a weapon. For centuries they have defended the City. But that defense cannot hold forever.

Now, with the Darkness rising again, the time has come to retake our lost worlds. The Guardians who lead the way will save humanity - and become legend.

##History
The human Golden Age, which lasted for thousands of years, came to a sudden close as the Great War began. Attacking abruptly with great violence and authority, The Darkness swiftly destroyed human populations throughout the solar system. Trillions of human lives were ended in the first stages of the attack against the Traveler. Approaching extinction, the humans were forced to return to Earth to seek shelter from the shielding aura of the Traveler.

Confronting its nemesis, the Darkness ravaged the Traveler, almost wiping it out. In its final counter attack, the Traveler momentarily overcame The Darkness. It created Ghosts to seek out Guardians of the Light and assist them in their battle against The Darkness. Constrained to The City, the Guardians plan and execute explorations from The Tower, while preparing for the ongoing battle against the Darkness. Their ultimate quest is to find a way to revive the Traveler.

## Creating a Guardian
In general, we follow the same steps to create a Guardian that are outlined in the Player's Handbook (PHB:11), but your choices will be limited to those races and classes presented here.  Here is a summary of character creation steps.

### 1.) Choose a Race
The following races are available.  The race you choose may grant your character certain racial traits, skills, proficiencies and bonuses to ability scores.
* Awoken
 * Earthborn
 * Reefborn
* Exo
* Human

### 2.) Choose a Class
Characters in Destiny are Guardians, raised by Ghosts and blessed by the Traveler, they use the power they are granted to protect the last remnants of Humanity from the ravages of the forces of Darkness.  Fallen, Hive, Vex, or Cabal; every threat must be faced down.  The following Guardian classes are available.
* Titan
* Hunter
* Warlock

### 3.) Roll Attributes
You're going to roll dice to determine the values of the 6 stats, Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.  For each stat, roll 4d6 and drop the lowest result.  This should give you a value between 3 and 18.  You can assign the numbers that you roll to abilities based on your class strengths.  Remember to add stat bonuses from your chosen race.

### 4.) Choose your Background
Your background describes and defines who your character was before he/she became a Guardian.  Many Human and Awoken Guardians were resurrected by their Ghosts.  Exo Guardians may have been reconstructed or recently wiped.  Your Guardian may remember all, some, or none of their past, at the player's and GM's discretion.  But the skills they learned from their backgrounds are still available.

You may use pretty much any background you can come up with, so long as it is acceptable by you and your GM.  Work with your GM to generate the appropriate skills and equipment for your background.

You can find some example backgrounds from these places:
* Player's Handbook (PHB:125-141)
* [D&D Wiki: Backgrounds](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_Backgrounds)

### 5.) Gather Gear and Equipment
You will start with basic equipment for your class and your background may grant you some gear as well.
