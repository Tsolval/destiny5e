_"Don't underestimate a cutthroat, or you'll get your throat cut."_

Dregs cling to the lowest rung of Fallen society. Docked of their lower arms in a ritual of humiliation and obedience, Dregs seek to prove their worth. Only a few will survive to gain promotion and regrow their limbs. Their suicidal bravery is fueled by ambition and shame.

Dregs are the lowest class of Fallen, whose ranks seem to be based on honor.  Dregs are held in low regard by other Fallen and regarded as expendable cannon fodder.  A Dreg who proves himself in battle will gain (or regain) his honor, be allowed to regrow his arms, and be welcomed among the ranks of the Vandals.  Dregs are similar to other Fallen classes, but are generally smaller and sport a large crest of hair.

Dregs usually carry Shock Daggers and Shock Pistols, occasionally using Shock Grenades, and rarely Shrapnel Launchers. They are undisciplined fighters, and will hiss and clatter, revealing their position. They seem to wear only light armor with little to no exo-atmospheric protection, and will melee at close ranges, though they aren't as strong as more elite Fallen variants.

Dregs can sometimes be seen riding Pikes.

Most Dregs are cannon fodder and do not provide much in the way of resistance. However, what they lack in weaponry and skill, they make up for in numbers. A Guardian must take care to not be surrounded by too many, lest they be overwhelmed. In addition, Dregs on Pikes should be considered a serious threat.
