## [Shank](See more at: http://destiny-grimoire.info/#Card-207150)
_"Death flies on tarnished wings."_

Shanks are the bulldogs of the Fallen. Small and tough enough to go where Dregs won't fit, they scout, keep watch, and patrol. Fallen Walkers deploy Shanks from internal bays for tactical support and field repairs.

Shanks appear to glide using a pair of vertical jet engines, and are able to hover. They have an oblate (flattened) spheroid chassis featuring a glowing red "eye". A small energy weapon is mounted beneath it, between a pair of stabilizers.

Shanks attack in small swarms and fire small plasma cannons in short bursts. For the most part, their attacks are relatively weak. They can also boost themselves up to avoid grenades or small arms fire, but this tactic isn't used often.  Because their offensive capabilities appear to be based on attacking in numbers, individual Shanks are lightly armored and are easily destroyed.  Some Shanks have a shield that is vulnerable to Solar damage.

The House of Wolves also employs three variants of the Shank. The Repeater Shank uses a Shock Mini-Gun to suppress and harass, the enemy.  The Exploder Shank acts as a suicide bomber, advancing on and exploding on its victims.  And the Tracer Shank, equipped with a Sniper Carbine, can pick off targets from a distance.
