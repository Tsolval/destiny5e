>My name is Eriana-3, disciple of the Praxic Warlocks, marked by the Cormorant Seal. We came here under one banner, united in a host of thousands, to claim the Moon. But the battle goes against us. I have taken a prisoner and this is the record of its interrogation. If I transgress in your eyes I ask for your forgiveness.

>[sound of current or discharge]

>/Eriana. It responds to pain.

>It responds to the Light. Hurt it again. Monster, heed me. Who is your master with the sword?

>[static event]

>I can hear it. In my head. The swordbearer's name is CROTA. Record that.

>/Should I burn it again?

>No. I think you're only feeding it. I will touch its mind. Ghost - help.

>They call you Wizard. You must be ancient. I think you value power very much. Will you still be powerful without this piece of your mind?

>Tell me how to kill Crota.

>[static event]

>It showed me the battle. It showed me Wei Ning dead on Crota's blade. It showed me how Crota killed a Guardian with a screaming knife hammered out of his own Ghost.

>So I will take a piece of its mind, and ask again.

>Tell me how to kill Crota.

>[static event]

>Incredible. Where? Where is his throne? Where is the twilight world under the dead star eye?

>/Eriana there's word from the company in Mare Imbrium. Crota is upon them. Half a hundred dead. They need us.

>Tell me where! Tell me how! TELL ME!

>[static event]

>/Eriana what did it say -

>It showed me how it did this, just exactly this, to an Awoken man, the knives arranged by its will, like little silver ships, like Ghosts -

>It laughed at me. It said we were the same.

>/Crota marches with a thousand Knights and they say the sky above Mare Imbrium has turned into green fire. They are dying in numbers I cannot bear to repeat. He kills them one by one with a sword that eats their Light. Eriana, we have to do something -

>Kill the Wizard. Scatter the ash. It has nothing but lies to offer.

>Get your Sparrows. We have Light and fury. That will be enough

## Class Features
### Arcane Optics
You have spent many hours researching the Traveler's gift and have gained a few insights into the nature of Light which allow you to manipulate it to your advantage.  At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the Traditional Warlock spell list at the bottom of this page.  You may learn additional cantrips at higher levels, as indicated in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.  A Warlock's Bond is the spell focus and is required for casting these cantrips.

### Awakened Mind
Starting at 1st level, your alien knowledge gives you the ability to touch the minds of other creatures.  You can telepathically speak to any creature you can see within 30 feet of you.  You don't need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language.  This is how Eriana-3 interrogated the Hive Wizard.

### Eldritch Invocations
In your study of the Traveler's Light, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.

At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description.  When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.

### Traveler's Light
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel the Traveler's Light to heal wounds.  You have a pool of d6s that you spend to fuel this healing.  The number of dice in the pool equals 1 + your warlock level.  As a bonus action, you can touch a creature and heal it, spending dice from the pool.  The maximum number of dice you can spend at once equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one die).  Roll the dice you spend, add them together, and restore a number of hit points equal to the total.  Your pool regains all expended dice when you finish a long rest.

### Warlock Discipline
At level 2, you begin to grow into the power granted to you by the light which infuses you.  Choose one of the available warlock disciplines, see below.  Your choice grants you features as you gain levels.

---
#### Light Pools
When you choose your Warlock Discipline at level 2, you gain access to three pools of Light. One supplies power to your special melee attacks, one empowers your grenades, and one is used for your super ability. All pools start at 0 Light. The melee pool has a maximum of 20 Light points, the grenade pool max is 30, and the pool empowering your super ability maxes at 50 points. During its round, your ghost distills Light from the environment, enemies you've destroyed, and Orbs of Light you've encountered, and distributes it to your resource pools. See the section on Ghosts for more information.

#### [Glide](http://destiny-grimoire.info/#Card-301030)
_Break the bonds of gravity and convert your jump into a long, smooth glide. Cross dangerous terrain and float from perch to perch to keep the high ground._

At level 2, you gain the Glide ability which allows you to use your Light to neutralize your own gravity.  Depending on how it is used, Glide can extend either your long jump or your high jump as described below.

##### Long Jump
When you make a long jump with Glide, you can cover a number of feet up to twice your Wisdom score (not modifier) if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump.  A standing long jump covers only half that distance.  Each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of distance.

##### High Jump
When you make a high jump with Lift, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to (3 + willpower modifier) * 2 if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump.  A standing long jump covers only half this distance.  Each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.

At 8th level, your Glide gains a feature of your choice based on your Discipline.  Sunsingers and Stormcallers can choose between Focused Control, Focused Burst, and Balanced Glide, while Voidwalkers can choose between Focused Control, Focused Burst, and Blink.

Feature | Description | Benefit
:---|:---|:---
**Focused Control:** | Upgrades Glide for better directional control while in mid-air. | You can now change direction up to 90 degrees once while in the middle of a jump.
**Focused Burst:** | Upgrades Glide to provide an initial burst of speed. | You gain +10 Movement during rounds when you use Focused Burst.
**Balanced Glide:** | Upgrades Glide to provide bonuses to both speed and control. | You gain +5 Movement during rounds when you use Balanced Glide and you may alter your jump direction up to 45 degrees in any direction once while in the air.
**Blink:** | Teleport a short distance. | You teleport up to your maximum Glide distance.  You cannot blink through solid obstacles, and you have to be able to see where you are going, but you can Blink over traps, difficult terrain, etc.

#### Grenade
See your chosen discipline for more details.

#### Super Ability
See your chosen discipline for more details.

#### Palm
See your chosen discipline for more details.

#### Arcane Study
At level 6, you specialize in one of these Warlock Ideals. Choose one and gain its benefits.

Ideal | Description | Benefit

**Arcane Wisdom:** | Training focused on battle recovery and speed. | Movement +5, Recovery -1
**Arcane Spirit:** | Training focused on battle recovery and toughness. | AC +1, Recovery -1
**Arcane Force:** | Training focused on toughness and speed. | AC +1, Movement +5

#### Ancient Order
At level 7, you are invited to join these Warlock Orders. Choose one and gain its benefits.

Order | Description | Benefit

#### Discipline Loyalty Feature
See your chosen Discipline for more details.

#### Discipline Leadership Feature
See your chosen Discipline for more details.

---
### Traveler's Gift
At 3rd level, the Traveler has gifted you with a repository of knowledge to aid you in your arcane endeavors.  Your ghost provides you with direct access to this knowledge.  When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class's spell list (the three needn't be from the same list). So long as your ghost is near (within 5 feet), you can cast those cantrips at will. They don't count against your number of cantrips known. If they don't appear on the Warlock spell list, they are nonetheless Warlock spells for you.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two Ability Scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.  Alternatively, you can choose to adopt a single Feat instead of taking this Ability increase.

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the attack action on your turn.

### Will of the Light
Starting at 6th level, you can call on the Traveler's Light to alter fate in your favor.  When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add a d10 to your roll.  You can do so after seeing the initial roll, but before any of the rolls effects occur.  Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Entropic Ward
At 7th level, you learn to magically ward yourself against attack and to turn an enemy’s failed strike into good luck for yourself.  When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on that roll.  If the attack misses you, your next attack roll against the creature has advantage if you make it before the end of your next turn.  Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Mystic Arcanum
At 9th level, the Traveler bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum.  Choose one 5th level spell from the warlock spell list below as this arcanum.  You can cast your arcanum spell once and then you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.  At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 6th-level spell at 11th level, one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, one 9th-level spell at 17th level and another spell of any level at 20th level.  You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.

## Warlock Disciplines
### [Voidwalker](http://destiny-grimoire.info/#Card-307060)
_"Those who have stared into the Void are not bound by the laws of space and time."_
The Traveler came out of the void that surrounds all things. Thus we know that the void is full of power. Thus we enter the void without fear.

Small minds will call your abilities blasphemous. They will compare you to the abominable Wizards of the Hive.

But you will not be held back. Gifted with the Traveler's Light, armed with the secret physics of a lost age, you will tear reality asunder.

You will fear nothing, and nothing will not fear you.

#### Void Grenades
At level 2, you gain access to a special Light-powered grenade. These grenades consume 30 Light from your grenade resource pool.  As an action, a character can throw a grenade to any 5 foot area up to 60 feet away.  The grenade will explode, dealing 5d6 void damage.  Creatures within 10 feet who pass a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw take half damage.  Creatures between 10 and 20 feet from the grenade take half damage or no damage on a successful save.

At 9th level, select one of the following grenade types. Your grenade ability will be modified as described.

#### Super Ability - [Nova Bomb](http://destiny-grimoire.info/#Card-301160)
_Channel the Traveler's Light into a bolt of energy with the power of a collapsing star. The devastating Nova Bomb scours the battlefield with ethereal fire - but be careful in its use. It takes precious moments to summon, and it must be aimed precisely to avoid obstacles._

At level 3, you can spend 50 Light from your super ability pool to conjure and throw a mass of deadly Void energy toward any enemy within 60 feet. The Nova Bomb will explode as soon as it hits anything, releasing a blast of Void Light with a 20 foot radius.  All enemies within the blast area that fail a DC 17 Dexterity save take 8d12 Void damage + Willpower modifier or half if they succeed.

At level 10, you can choose one of the following additional features for your Nova Bomb.

At level 4, you gain access to a special Light-enhanced, close-quarters, hand-to-hand melee attack. This melee consumes 20 Light from your melee resource pool and upgrades a standard melee attack.  You can use this attack on any enemy within 5 feet to deal 1d8 void damage for every Warlock level plus your Wisdom modifier damage.

_"There are flames that even the Darkness cannot extinguish."_

These are dark times.  Humanity stands on the brink of extinction.  We will carry fire into that darkness - a beacon to guide the way, and a pyre to consume our great enemy.

The Light saved us from death and forged us into weapons. We seek to understand it, to embrace it, to consume and be consumed by it. We hope to become radiant.

Our fellow Guardians need our power. Our civilization needs our strength.

#### Super Ability - [Radiance](http://destiny-grimoire.info/#Card-301170)
_Open yourself to the Light. Glimpse, for a few rapturous moments, the truth beyond the powers you wield._

A Warlock in a state of Radiance threatens to slip beyond the bonds of the material, shrugging off physical harm, channeling a torrent of abilities. Some may learn to elevate nearby Guardians, gifting them with power. Others, entranced by the Ghosts' power to reach beyond death, may learn to pluck themselves out of nothingness like the phoenix of ancient myth.

At level 3, you can spend 50 Light from your super ability pool to bathe yourself in Light for 5 rounds, strengthening your grenade and melee damage and lowering their cooldowns.

“Harmony within, hurricane without.”

_Focus your Light to call forth a powerful Arc storm, and siphon it, channeling lightning through your fingertips to send it surging between your targets. A Warlock in Stormtrance is exercising such unbreakable focus that the Arc energy they summon draws them off the ground, the air humming and crackling around them. Like lightning you bend your path forward through the air, striking down anything too slow escape the storm._

## Eldritch Invocations
If an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it.  You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its prerequisites.  A level prerequisite refers to your Warlock level.

### Agonizing Blast
**Prerequisite:** _eldritch blast_ cantrip

When you cast _eldritch blast_, add your Wisdom modifier to the damage it deals on a hit.

### Armor of Shadows
You can cast _mage armor_ on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.

### Ascendant Step
**Prerequisite:** 9th level

You can cast _levitate_ on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.

### Beast Speech
You can cast _speak with animals_ at will, without expending a spell slot.

### Book of Ancient Secrets
You and your ghost have worked out how to cast ritual spells.  Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class's spell list (the two needn't be from the same list).  Your ghost internalizes the spells in a database called the Book of Light.  So long as your ghost is nearby (within 5 feet), you can cast the chosen spells as rituals.

On your adventures, you may run across other ritual spells.  When you find such a spell, if its level is equal to or less than half your Warlock level (rounded up), you and your Ghost can work on adding it to your database, but the process takes time and glimmer.  For each level of the spell, this transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 500 glimmer for the materials needed to research it.

### Devil's Sight
You can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet.

As long as the creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can use your action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn.  While perceiving through the other creature's senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you are blinded and deafened to your own surroundings.

### Mask of Many Faces
