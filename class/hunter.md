>She leaves the Sparrow and climbs a long way across spars of volcano rock and between vents of blue fire. Down below the Ishtar ruins spark with skirmish light but the guns seem as distant and brief as the constant starfall and the brooding crater high above. She is alone on the rock. She goes on with her head down so as to fight the sense that she is going to fall up off the world and burn like an inverse meteor.

>The message that brought her to this place had no sign but she could hear Cayde in it. Draksis in the Cinders it said. Is it true?

>And also: Remember your promise.

>At dawn she finds a sentry and kills it with her knife. Its throat bleeds gas. She takes its post and lays out her bullets one by one on the rock as if to make a count of all the years she has been waiting. Her rifle is near as long as she is tall. She lies down by her bullets and uses them to kill the other sentries one by one until at last they understand the thunder and the Shanks rise up angry from the Cinders below to seek her out.

>She leaves the rifle and walks across the naked obsidian into the swarm firing from the hip as she goes, each kick of the old revolver a word, Draksis, Draksis, Kell of Winter, Kell of hate, lord of the kingdom of her vendetta. Her jaw aches. She used to imagine biting out his throat with armored teeth.

>The stone smokes around her where the arc fire lashes it and the shrapnel guns throw up leaves of obsidian like glass butterflies. She shoots her bandoliers dry and a team of Vandals in glassy stealth leap up to rush her with knives but she raises her hand and burns them down with the golden gun, laughing, crying out Draksis, Draksis, I am come!

>She kills them all and takes the next ridge, high above the Cinders. She can see the blue-green pools and the cave mouths where the Vex lights dance. And there among them, gowned in smoke and ash, is the long shark shape of a Ketch, a Wintership, the Kell's ship, come down to nest.

>She could go down there now and finish this. But she made a promise.

>A Captain jumps her. She throws two knives into his armor and then staves his chest in with her own Ghost, wrapped up in her fist like a stone.

>"Tell the Vanguard," she says to her Ether-spattered fist. "Tell them Draksis is here."

>Her Ghost looks up at her in silence. When she makes no move to go down the cliff towards the ship it blinks once, in its own way, and makes a soft sound, like a sigh, like relief.

At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves' tools) to gain this benefit.

### Sneak Attack
Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a Finesse or a ranged weapon.

You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't Incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Hunter's table.

You are a master of navigating the natural world, and you react with swift and decisive action when attacked. This grants you the following benefits:

* You ignore difficult terrain.
* You have advantage on initiative rolls.
* On your first turn during combat, you have advantage on attack rolls against creatures that have not yet acted.

In addition, you are skilled at navigating the wilderness. You gain the following benefits when traveling for an hour or more:

* Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.
* If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
* When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.
* While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.

### Cunning Action
Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a Bonus Action on each of your turns in Combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

### Hunter Society
At level 2, you begin to grow into the power granted to you by the light which infuses you. Choose one of the available hunter societies, see below. Your choice grants you features as you gain levels.

---
#### Light Pools
When you choose your Hunter Society at level 2, you gain access to three pools of Light. One supplies power to your special melee attacks, one empowers your grenades, and one is used for your super ability. All pools start at 0 Light. The melee pool has a maximum of 20 Light points, the grenade pool max is 30, and the pool empowering your super ability maxes at 50 points. During its round, your ghost distills Light from the environment, enemies you've destroyed, and Orbs of Light you've encountered, and distributes it to your resource pools. See the section on Ghosts for more information.

#### [Double Jump](http://destiny-grimoire.info/#Card-301020)
_Bend momentum to jump again in mid-air. Leap to even greater heights, or make a quick adjustment while airborne to disorient your foes._

At level two, you gain the Double Jump ability which allows you to make a dexterous second leap while still in the air.  Depending on how it is used, Double Jump can extend either your long jump or your high jump as described below.

##### Long Jump
When you make a long jump with Double Jump, you can cover a number of feet up to twice your Dexterity score (not modifier) if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump.  A standing long jump covers only half that distance.  Each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of distance.

##### High Jump
When you make a high jump with Double Jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to (3 + dexterity modifier) * 2 if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump.  A standing long jump covers only half this distance.  Each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.

At 8th level, your Double Jump ability gains one of three features based on your selected Hunter Society.  Nightstalkers and Gunslingers can choose between Increased Control, Increased Height, and Triple Jump.  Bladedancers get to choose between Increased Control, Increased Height, and Blink.

Feature | Description | Benefit
:---|:---|:---
**Increased Height:** | Upgrades Double Jump to travel to greater height. | Increases your high jump to (3 + dexterity modifier) * 3.
**Increased Control:** | Upgrades Double Jump for better directional control while in the air. | You can now change direction up to 90 degrees once while in the middle of a jump.
**Triple Jump:** | Upgrades Double Jump to Triple Jump, allowing you to jump while in the air twice. | You can now long and high jump up to triple the normal distance.
**Blink:** | Teleport a short distance. | You teleport up to your maximum Double Jump distance. You cannot blink through solid obstacles, and you have to be able to see where you are going, but you can Blink over traps, difficult terrain, etc.

#### Grenade

---
### Hunter's Prey
At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

Feature | Description
:---|:---
**Colossus Slayer:** | Your tenacity can wear down the most potent foes.  When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage if it's below its hit point maximum. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.
**Giant Killer:** | When a Large or larger creature within 5 feet of you hits or misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to attack that creature immediately after its attack, provided that you can see the creature.
**Horde Breaker:** | Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two Ability Scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Alternatively, you can choose to adopt a single Feat instead of taking this Ability increase.

### Uncanny Dodge
Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.

### Evasion
Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

### Hide in Plain Sight
Starting at 9th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, Plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.

Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.

### Multiattack
At 11th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

#### Volley
You can use your action to make a ranged attack against any number of creatures within 10 feet of a point you can see within your weapon's range. You must have ammunition for each target, as normal, and you make a separate attack roll for each target.

#### Whirlwind Attack
You can use your action to make a melee attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target.

### Feral Senses
At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can't see. When you attack a creature you can't see, your inability to see it doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it. You are also aware of the location of any Invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't Blinded or Deafened.

### Elusive
Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't Incapacitated.

### Stroke of Luck
At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Hunter Societies

#### Super Ability - [Shadowshot](http://destiny-grimoire.info/#Card-700110)
_Summon the power of the Void to draw back and launch a precision long-range projectile that reaches out and snares enemies with slowing, draining tethers of Void Light. Shadowshot lets a Hunter's dead-eye precision carve a path to new battles._

At level 3, you can spend 50 Light from your super resource pool to fire a Void energy vortex to a spot up to 60 feet away.  This anchor reaches tendrils of void energy toward up to 10 enemies no more than 20 feet away for 5 rounds. If you hit an enemy (roll to hit and add your Dexterity modifier and proficiency bonus) with Shadowshot, that enemy takes 5d10 + Dexterity modifier damage from the attack.  Tethered enemies move as if they were in difficult terrain.  Drained enemies cannot use abilities such as grenade, melee, or super abilities.  The Shadowshot is destructible and has hit points equivalent to twice it's creator's maximum hit points.

At level 10, you can choose one of the following additional features for your Super ability.

Feature | Description | Benefit
:---|:---|:---
**Blood Bound:** | Tethered enemies explode when killed. Damage to tethered enemies is shared to all. | When a tethered enemy takes damage, apply the damage to every other tethered enemy.  When killed, tethered enemies explode and do splash damage like a grenade.
**Black Hole:** | The Void Anchor has increased range, lasts significantly longer, and can tether more targets. | Tether may now reach up to 15 enemies no more than 25 feet away and lasts for 6 rounds.
**Quiver:** | Fire Shadowshot up to three times. Void Anchors have reduced range. | You can fire up to three projectiles.  Range is reduced to 15 feet.

#### Smoke
At level 4, you gain access to a special Light-enhanced, chemical-based smoke bomb attack which consumes 20 light from your melee resource pool.  You can throw a smoke bomb to any point within 20 feet, where it will explode, creating a smoke cloud with a 15 foot diameter that persists for 3 rounds.  The smoke cloud is considered difficult terrain to anyone you consider an enemy, and any enemies in or passing through that cloud take 1d4 void damage per Hunter level and are blinded for 3 rounds.

At 11th level, choose one of the following features to add to your Smoke.

Feature | Description | Benefit

**Envenomed:** | Adds a toxin that damages enemies within the smoke. | Any creature who inhales the toxin must pass a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 3d6 poison damage and must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns.  On each successive failed save, the creature takes 1d6 poison damage.  After three successful saves the poison ends. Poisoned enemies have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.
**Vanish in Smoke:** | You and allies near Smoke explosions vanish from sight. | Allies hit by the smoke are invisible for 3 rounds.
**Snare:** | Allows smoke to stick to surfaces, detonating when enemies are near. | Smoke pellets stick to surfaces and detonate when enemies enter their area of effect.
