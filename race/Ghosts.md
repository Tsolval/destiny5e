# [Ghosts](http://destiny-grimoire.info/#Card-103090)
_"In its dying breath, the Traveler created the Ghosts...To seek out those who can wield its Light as a weapon. Guardians, to protect us, and do what the Traveler itself no longer can."_
___
Built from machinery and the Traveler's Light, Ghosts guide their Guardian companions in the quest to reclaim our solar system.

Every Ghost seeks out its Guardian among the ancient dead. The Ghost serves as scout, librarian, and mechanic, waking ancient machinery and cracking alien codes. In the right situations, a Ghost can even save a Guardian from death.

But Ghosts are not immortal. As far as Guardians know, every loss is irreplaceable.

## Ghosts as NPCs
The following NPC template represents a Ghost without a Guardian. When you create your Ghost, start with this template and then flesh it out using the rules in the Companion Creation section that follows.

### Ghost
_Tiny machine, any good alignment_
___
**Armor Class:** 13 (defensive shell)<br>
**Hit Points:** 6 (1d8 + 1)<br>
**Speed:** 0 ft., fly 60 ft, spaceflight 1 Gm per day
___

 STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA 
-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----
 6 (-2) | 14 (+2) | 13 (+1) | 13 (+1) | 14 (+2) | 10 (+0)

___
**Spaceflight:** A Ghost is capable of traveling through space at the rate of ~1 gigameter per day. At this rate, and depending on the current state of the solar system, a Ghost on Earth could travel unaided to the Moon in about 9 hours, to Mars in around 60 days or to Venus in around 270 days.
___

#### Actions:
**Life Bond (1 time only):** An unbonded Ghost can merge with the residue of light from a once living creature and return it to life. Once, and only once, a Ghost can cast True Resurrection on a creature that it deems worthy. Upon the spell's completion, the Ghost becomes permanently, symbiotically bonded to the creature. If the bonded creature dies, the Ghost can recover its seed and use it to bond to another creature. After a suitable morning period, of course.
___

## Companion in the Light
Your Ghost brought you back from the dead. It keeps you healthy and alive and tries to keep you in good humor as well. When you face the darkness, your Ghost lights your way and keeps you company, reminding you that you're never truly alone. Without your Ghost, you are little more than a zombie, slowly eating through the last of your stolen life. And without a Guardian, a Ghost is not much more than a floating calculator.

Your Ghost, a central part of your Guardian, is an NPC controlled by the GM, but with absolute loyalty to you. On the day of your resurrection, your Ghost planted a seed of itself in you to catalyze the regrowth of your light. Because of this, without being told or having to ask, your Guardian and Ghost know each other's name, alignment, and base personality and your Ghost automatically knows any language that you knew at the time.

While Ghosts do not fight alongside you in the traditional sense, they perform a number of indispensable functions on the battlefield. They offer knowledge, communication, and logistics, they give you advice, and they obey your orders to the best of their ability. Oh, and they can also bring you back from the dead. So, you know. Go crazy.

## Companion Creation
When you create your Ghost (or when your Ghost creates you?), your GM will give you a character sheet for your Ghost and ask you to fill it out. Start by copying the statistics from the template above and then apply the features below.

### Ability Score Increase
Your Ghost can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

### Hit Points
**Hit Dice:** 1d8 per Guardian Level<br>
**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + the Ghost's Constitution modifier<br>
**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + the Ghost's Constitution modifier for each of the Guardian's levels after 1st.<br>

###  Proficiencies
Your Ghost will use your Guardian's proficiency modifier instead of its own. This bonus applies to all the skills in which your Ghost is proficient, all your Ghost's saving throws, and also applies to your Ghost's Armor Class.

**Armor Class:** Your Ghost's armor class is now influenced by your proficiency bonus. AC is now calculated as: 10 + Dexterity Modifier + Guardian Proficiency<br>
**Saving Throws:** The Ghost is now proficient in all saving throws.<br>
**Skills:** In addition to the Perception and Insight skills, with which your Ghost was already proficient, your bonding will grant it proficiency in two more skills from this list: Arcana, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Religion, Sleight of Hand, Stealth, and Survival<br>

### Equipment
Your Ghost has Thieves' Tools, for opening doors, and a long range communication system capable of transmitting and receiving messages across the distances between planets. What else did you expect? A Cuisinart?

### Features
#### Symbiotic Cadence
The Life Bond grants a Ghost and its Guardian a strong spiritual and physical tie, giving the pair a certain symbiotic cadence. Starting at 1st level, your Ghost will always use the Guardian's initiative to determine when it can move. The turns are resolved separately, but order doesn't matter. The Ghost can move first or act after the Guardian as the player chooses. Note that the only time that the Ghost and Guardian may act seperately is when one or the other chooses to use the Ready action.

In addition, The Ghost can use a bonus action to merge with or separate from his Guardian. When merged, the Ghost cannot be seen or heard by anyone except for its host and it can only collect resources from the areas that the host has passed through. This merging is a product of their unique bond. The Ghost cannot merge with anything else this way.

#### Resurrection
At 1st Level your Ghost gains the ability to resurrect its Life Bond partner. Doing so requires that, either there are no threats within visible range, or there is an ally within 5 feet and no threats within 10 feet.  When the Guardian is resurrected, reset the melee, grenade, and super ability light pools to 0, as it was all consumed in the process.

At higher levels, your Ghost becomes more efficient at resurrections. At 5th Level, your Guardian only loses half of the light in each pool, and at 7th level, your Guardian doesn't lose any light.

#### Light's Defense
The Ghost becomes better able to protect itself in the presence of its host. Starting at 2nd Level, while it can see your Guardian, your Ghost has advantage on all saving throws.

#### Improved Light's Defense
At 3rd Level, whenever an attacker that your Ghost can see hits it with an attack, it can use its reaction to gain resistance to piercing, bludgeoning, and slashing damage.

#### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach the 4th level, and again at 6th and 8th levels, your Ghost can increase one ability score of your choice by 2 or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

#### Font of Light
At 9th Level, your Ghost gains the ability to completely replenish all of your light pools instantly. Your Ghost must be merge with you and use its action to fill you with light. Your pools are all instantly maxed out, and you look super cool too.

### Personality
#### Details
Finally, it's time to flesh out your Ghost. Describe what it looks and sounds like, assign it a gender, and give it a name.

#### Ghost Names
|            |         |          |
|------------|---------|----------|
| Cassiopeia | Obverse | Obsidian | 

#### Alignment
Your Ghost will always have the same alignment as you. Although it may try to guide your choices to prevent it, If your alignment shifts over the course of the game, your Ghost will shift along with you.

#### Languages
An unbonded Ghost only knows the common tongue, but during the bonding process, your Ghost absorbed knowledge of any language that you knew at the time. Any language you may learn in the future, your Ghost will likely study as well, but it will not be able to absorb knowledge from you directly after the bonding.

#### Traits
You must select a personality trait and a flaw for your Ghost. You can roll on or choose from the tables below, or you can make up your own with your GM's approval. Your Ghost will share your Ideal, and it's Bond will always be "The Guardian who travels with me is a beloved companion for whom I would gladly give my life."

| d8 | Trait |
|---|---|
| 1 | I'm a terrible coward, but I refuse to leave my Guardian. |
| 2 | Threaten my friends, threaten me. |
| 3 | I stay on alert so others can rest. |
| 4 | People underestimate me because of my size. I use that to my advantage. |
| 5 | I have a knack for opening doors in the nick of time. |
| 6 | I put my friends' needs before my own in all things. |
| 7 | I have a joke for every occasion. Especially occasions where humor is inappropriate. |
| 8 | I like to squeeze into small places where no one else can get to me. |

| d6 | Flaw |
|----|------|
| 1  | The monstrous enemy we faced in battle still leaves me quivering in fear. |
| 2  | I can't keep a secret to save my life, or anyone else's.                  |
| 3  | I'd risk too much to uncover a lost bit of knowledge.                     |
| 4  | I have trouble keeping my true feelings hidden. My sharp tongue lands me in trouble. |
|5|I'm convinced of the significance of my Guardian's destiny, and blind to his/her shortcomings and the risk of failure.|
| 6  | By my words and actions, I often bring shame to my Guardian. |

## Actions
Every round, your Ghost can take it's Movement, Action, Bonus Action, and Reaction, just like a character. The following sections define what a Ghost can do in an action.

### Light Collection
Your Ghost is responsible for collecting and funneling to its Guardian the fundamental source of their power, Light. Your Ghost uses its bonus action to siphon this light from the environment, dead enemies, and nearby Orbs dropped by other Guardians. The amount of light collected is variable. Consult the table below.

Source | Amount | Circumstance
-------------|:----:|-------------------------------------------------------
Orb of Light | 1d6  | Guardian passed within 5 feet of orb during the round
Normal Enemy | 1d4  | Guardian action resulted in enemy death
Major Enemy  | 1d6  | Guardian action resulted in enemy death
Elite Enemy  | 1d8  | Guardian action resulted in enemy death
Boss Enemy   | 1d10 | Guardian action resulted in enemy death
Environment  | 1d12 | Neither Ghost nor Guardian incapacitated

### Ammo Collection
Your Ghost can help you collect ammunition boxes to help restock your ammo pouch. Your Ghost will collect any ammo packs in its path. In order for your Guardian to gain the new ammo, the Ghost must end its turn within 5 feet of or merged with the Guardian. Your Ghost can carry up to half the amount of ammo that you can carry in your pouch.

### Regenerate
Your Ghost can help provide for your health, but backlashes from being attacked complicate the process and prevent recovery. If you are hurt, but haven't been injured in at least 5 rounds (30 seconds), your Ghost can use the Regenerate action to initiate the healing process.

When your Ghost spends its action to Regenerate, immediately roll your Guardian's hit die and add the result back to your health pool. Roll the hit die again at the beginning of every round until either you have completely regained all your health or until you have taken damage.  Note that a Ghost only has to take an action to start the regeneration process.  You can still regenerate health on subsequent rounds while your Ghost performs other actions. 

Any ability or skill which reduces the recovery cooldown reduces the number of rounds after injury before your Ghost can use Regenerate to a minimum of 1.

### Defend
If your Guardian falls unconsious on the battlefield, your Ghost can take a defend action, greatly enhancing your chance to survive.  When this action is taken, your Ghost goes enters a protective stance over your body, encasing you both in a protective shell which guards your Light from consumption.  This stance imposes disadvantage on any attack against you or the Ghost and grants advantage on your death saves.  Have your ghost take this action as soon as possible when you fall unconscious.

### Resurrect
If there are no threats within visible range, or if an ally stands within 5 feet and there are no threats within 10 feet, your Ghost will resurrect you.  The resurrection process takes the full turn.  The Ghost cannot move, speak, or take any other action during the turn and the Guardian is resurrected at the start of his/her next turn with a single hitpoint.  
___

## Death
When you fall unconscious in battle, have your Ghost take the Defend action as soon as possible, and continue to defend as long as you can. Hopefully you'll pass your three death saves, stabilize, and then your Ghost can use the Regenerate action on you to begin your recovery and get you back into the fight. 

If you die, however, you will lose control over your Ghost completely.  If your Ghost wasn't Defending when you died, and it is within visible range, it will immediately move to Defend, despite any previous orders.  It will be able to do nothing but Defend so long as it can see a threat.   If the threat is cleared, or there is another Guardian within 5 feet and no enemies within 10 feet, your Ghost will resurrect you.

If the threat cannot be pushed back, the creatures of Darkness will consume the last reservoirs of your light, and your Guardian will be forever gone.  If this happens, your Guardian is dead and cannot be ressurrected.  

Most Ghosts would find the thought of abandoning their Guardian abhorrent, at best.  But if circumstances somehow prevent it from protecting you, or if it is forced away, your Ghost may survive your death.  A survivor such as this, if it doesn't self-destruct or fall into despair, may begin the search for another Guardian.

## Dead Ghosts
> Battered and drained of their Light, these Ghosts are nevertheless valuable for the information they preserve. Their recovered memories may well prove vital to the City's survival.

> The problem of dead Ghosts troubles the City's scholars. Are new Ghosts still being born? Or is the number of Ghosts dwindling? Will there come a day when no more remain - an end to the rise of new Guardians?

> If that day is coming, then the City faces a desperate race against time to heal the Traveler before attrition takes its toll.

> [Dead Ghosts](http://destiny-grimoire.info/#Card-103094)

Ghosts almost invariably refuse to abandon their Guardians.  So when a Guardian is killed in battle, the Ghost become vulnerable.  Ghosts will be targeted and, if possible, destroyed by the enemy to keep the Guardians from rising again.  

If the Ghost cannot revive their host quickly enough then both Ghost and Guardian are doomed.  Given the chance, creatures of Darkness will consume your Ghost.  If that happens, you will no longer be powered by Light and will age and die as any other living being.  

## Corrupted Ghosts
> Two more scans and she could move on to the elevated grid. There wasn't really anything new other than the delta to sea level, but at less than 30% of the way through 2<sup>128</sup> scans, even a distinction without a difference could feel like a brand new shell.

> "Cassiopeia!"

> So numb after months with just her own scans for company. She didn't even pick up on another Ghost being this close. "Obverse? Wait. I'm sorry. You're... Obsidian! Wow, how long has it been?"

> "Well, I mean..."

> "I know. It's been 6.8 years. It's just an expression."

> Obsidian floated closer. "That's okay. It HAS been a while. I guess you haven't found yours yet?"

> Cassiopeia projected glumness. "Not yet. But I haven't been looking on Mars for that long, at least! I'm optimistic."

> "You should be! I was just at the City last year. A lot more of us are starting to find our Guardians latel— what's that?"

> Cassiopeia resolved to run a full-range self-diagnostic before the next grid. Two Ghosts within twenty meters and she didn't sense either one? Something was off.

> The new arrival chirped and spoke up. "Hello, you two! I'm glad ~identify(OBSIDIAN)~ to see a friendly face! I haven't been myself lately."

> Obsidian looked at Cassiopeia. He read as nervous. She probably did, too.

> "I was beneath the Blind Watch for a while. A long ~SIVA.MEM.GH404~ while. It was fun! There were puzzles. No one was alive down there, though."

> Cassiopeia's scan of the new Ghost returned nothing amiss. "Are you okay, friend?"

> "I'm great! Something got in me but the Light ~if (LIGHT) then WARNING~ burned it away. It's gone forever, now! ~consume: FAILURE replicate:FAILURE enhance:FAILURE~"

> There was silence for a full three seconds. Then Obsidian spoke up, his words coming quickly.

> "Well, great to see you again, Cassiopeia! Good luck!" He zipped away.

> Cassiopeia watched him disappear into the horizon. "TWO self-diagnostics," she muttered.

> [Ghost Fragment: Ghosts 2](http://destiny-grimoire.info/#Card-800100)

Several fragments of lore have been discovered which speak of corrupted Ghosts.  These Ghosts wander aimlessly, silently, "buzzing with some sort of corruption", and appear to be searching for something.  Other Ghosts are frightened by their corrupted brethren, and neither they, nor the Speaker, nor the Warlocks understand the condition.
