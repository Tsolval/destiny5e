> I was nothingness. If I existed before, I existed as possibility, as potential, stretched thin across the aether. And maybe there was a body that looked like my body, complete with a soul that could be confused for someone rather like me. What I am now was not yet real. And then I was born, and the universe was free to begin.

> Others were present at my birth.

> A great ceremony had just begun. Because newborns are selfish beasts, I assumed I was the object of attention.

> I didn't notice the singing until the singers fell silent. And then She appeared.

> She was above me. Ethereal and handsome and elegant. I assumed my face was like her face and that odd idea gave me strength enough to smile.

> "Secrets," she said. "Creation is built on secrets and the encryptions that keep those secrets safe."

> I made my first sound. It meant nothing but she understood it as a question.

> "We are a beautiful creation," she said. "And we must keep ourselves very safe."

_"The others sing this song of Light and Dark. We, together, have transcended such unimaginative limitations."_
___
It is said that the Awoken were born in the Collapse, descended from those who tried to flee its wrath. Something happened to them out on the edge of the deep black, and they were forever changed.  Today many Awoken live in the distant Reef, aloof and mysterious. But others returned to Earth, where their descendants now fight for the City.  Earth-born Awoken who venture out to the Reef, hoping to learn its secrets, find no special welcome from the reclusive Queen.

Awoken are standoffish and resemble baseline humans, with the notable exception of having pale blue or gray skin. They also have luminescent eyes with glowing irises.  Beyond physical appearances, the Awoken seem to possess powers and abilities beyond their human ancestors. The Techeuns are a particularly notable example, though ordinary Awoken can also experience visions in the form of dreams.

## Awoken Traits
Your Awoken character has a variety of natural Abilities which are bestowed upon them by the nature of their particular evolution.

<dl>
  <dt>Ability Score Increase:</dt>
  <dd>Your Dexterity score increases by 2.</dd>
  <dt>Age:</dt>
  <dd>Awoken reach adulthood in their late teens and generally live for about a century.  An Awoken Guardian, sustained by Light, can live for much longer.</dd>
  <dt>Alignment:</dt>
  <dd>The Awoken society in the Reef is based on reaching out and taking what they need to survive. They scavenge and trade and fight for food, clothing, shelter, wealth, and power both for themselves and for their people. Though they are generally a good people, they simply don't respect any law except the law of strength. Most Reef-born Awoken are Chaotic Neutral.  Earth-born Awoken, however, take after their human brethren and are much more varied in Alignment.</dd>
  <dt>Size:</dt>
  <dd>Awoken generally fall into the same height and weight categories as Humans, though they tend toward a thinner, more predatory appearance. Your size is Medium.</dd>
  <dt>Speed:</dt>
  <dd>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</dd>
  <dt>Tool Proficiency</dt>
  <dd>Every Awoken must know how to contribute to the survival of their race.  Often times, this means repairing something or building something useful.  You gain proficiency with the artisan's tools of your choice: smith's tools, mechanic's tools, tinker's tools, shipwright's tools, carpenter's tools, engineer's tools, etc.</dd>
  <dt>Languages:</dt>
  <dd>You can speak, read, and write the Common and Awoken tongues.</dd>
  <dt>Subrace:</dt>
  <dd>Originally having banded together to flee the collapse of Human civilization, and suddenly finding themselves with nowhere to run, many Awoken chose to return to Earth and face their fate.  Others decided to build a new life, and a new fate, and set about turning their derelict ships into a home among the stars.  Thus was the Awoken Race divided.  You may choose one of the following subraces for your Awoken character.</dd>
</dl>

### Reefborn
Awoken born on the Reef are independent, proud, and stubborn.  They grow and prosper, or don't, knowing that the strong will survive and that their skill and perseverance are the only things keeping the void at bay.
<dl>
  <dt>Ability Score Increase:</dt>
  <dd>Increase your Charisma score by an additional 1 point.</dd>
  <dt>Darkvision:</dt>
  <dd>Accustomed as you are to Life in space and the dimly lit housing on the Reef, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.  You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.  You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</dd>
</dl>

### Earthborn
The Awoken that returned to Earth did not return defeated, but resolved to face the Darkness along side their Human ancestors.  To do so, they had to overcome many obstacles.  Then, when they reached Earth, they faced suspicion and reprisals from their Human brethren.  Convincing the Humans to overlook their strange appearance and accept their aid was not easy.
<dl>
  <dt>Ability Score Increase:</dt>
  <dd>Increase your Wisdom score by an additional 1 point.</dd>
  <dt>Empathic</dt>
  <dd>Your ancestors, and possibly you yourself, have had to learn to manipulate those around them in order to fit in.  You gain proficiency in Insight and one of the Charisma skills (Deception, Intimidation, Persuasion, or Performance).</dd>
