## Weapon Properties
<dl>
<dt>Ammunition</dt>
<dd>The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use.  Primary weapons, shotguns, sidearms, sniper rifles and Machine Guns use bullets.  Fusion Rifles and heavy swords use energy cells.  Rocket Launchers use missiles.  The ammunition from all of these weapons are formed from special packages of glimmer which read the configuration of your weapon and produce usable ammo for it.</dd>
<dt>Reload</dt>
<dd>A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reloaded property.  A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (if available - character's choice).  The number in the parenthesis is how many shots the weapon can make before the it needs to be reloaded.</dd>
<dt>Two Handed</dt>
<dd>This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.</dd>
<dt>Heavy</dt>
<dd>Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons.  A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.</dd>
<dt>Light</dt>

<dt>Burst Fire</dt>
<dd>A weapon that has the burst fire property can make a normal, single-target attack, or it can spray a 10-foot cube area within normal range with shots.

<dt>Automatic Fire</dt>
<dd>A weapon with the Automatic Fire property can apply burst fire to adjacent 10 foot cube areas, spending 10 pieces of ammunition for each area covered, up to the total amount of ammunition loaded.  If you do not have 10 ammunition to spend, you cannot spread your automatic fire to another area.  Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take the weapon's normal damage.</dd>
<dt>Rapid</dt>
<dd>This weapon fires very quickly, and can fire off multiple shots rapidly.  The number in the parenthesis represents the number of times per round that the weapon can be fired.</dd>

Creatures in the vicinity must make a DC 15 Dexterity save.  Creatures in the blast radius take full damage or half on a sucessful save.  Creatures in the shrapnel radius take half damage or no damage on a sucessful save.</dd>
<dt>Range</dt>
<dd>A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property.  The range lists two numbers.  The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range.  When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disavantage on the attack roll.

## [Upgrade Materials](http://destiny-grimoire.info/#Card-109020)
As Guardians buy or salvage new equipment, they learn to tinker and improve. This work requires Glimmer and other material.

Some can be recycled from unneeded gear. Titans favor plasteel, which can be found by disassembling old equipment. Hunters unspool discarded armor into sapphire wire. Warlocks extract hadronic essence from dismantled fieldweave robes. And any Guardian with a sense for weaponry can disassemble old ordnance into weapon parts.

Other materials need to be scavenged on site, generally in the course of Patrols. The Cosmodrome in Old Russia is rich with spinmetal, a fantastically light and strong composite created by rogue colonies of Golden Age machinery that escaped storage. Solar coil systems on the Moon still generate helium filaments. The baffling, possibly Vex-influenced flora of Venus grow spirit blooms. And the surface of Mars offers deposits of ultra-dense relic iron.

The most powerful Guardian equipment transcends ordinary science, entering the realm of Golden Age secrets and the Traveler's power itself. This wargear demands Ascendant Energy and Ascendant Shards - burning fragments of the universal fundament, earned through mighty acts of heroism.
Look for them in daily Story challenges and Raids.

## Weapon Rarity
There are several quality levels of weapons and some weapons are imbued with incredible properties that may make them extremely useful.
### Common
Common weapons are basic, and appear as described in the tables above.
### Uncommon
Uncommon weapons are of a slightly better quality than normal.  They act as +1 weapons and may have one Weapon Modification.  Roll once on the appropriate Weapon Modification table based on the weapon type.
### Rare
Rare weapons have a slight quality increase over Uncommon weapons.  They act as +2 weapons and may have up to two Weapon Modifications.  Roll twice on the appropriate Weapon Modification table based on the weapon type.
### Legendary
Legendary weapons, typically remnants of the Golden Age, are instruments of the highest quality.  They act as +3 weapons and may have up to three Weapon Modifications.  Roll three times on the appropriate Weapon Modification table based on the weapon type.
### Exotic
Exotic weapons are unique artifacts, carefully crafted to accentuate the traits of a specific warrior (or type of warrior).  Unlike other weapons, Exotic weapons require attunement, and you can only wield one Exotic weapon at any time.  Exotic weapons may may have one ore more prerequisites, in which case you must satisfy those prerequisites in order to attune to it.  Attuning to an Exotic weapon requires a short rest during which you must spend time with the weapon in question.  While every Exotic weapon is different, they typically have the same benefits as Legendary weapons in addition to a special property unique to this weapon.  Roll three times on the appropriate Weapon Modification table based on the weapon type and once on the Weapon Artifact table.
