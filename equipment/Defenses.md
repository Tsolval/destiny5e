# Defensive Equipment

Turrets - Turrets are immobile platforms which are used to defend a spot from enemies.  They are equally effective against vehicles and enemy hordes and can be carried in by a jumpship or hawk and deployed to a position just like a sparrow.  Most turrets mount dual mini-guns, but some fire rockets instead.
