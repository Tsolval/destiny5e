## Weapon Properties
<dl>
<dt>Ammunition</dt>
<dd>The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use.  Primary weapons, shotguns, sidearms, sniper rifles and Machine Guns use bullets.  Fusion Rifles and heavy swords use energy cells.  Rocket Launchers use missiles.  The ammunition from all of these weapons are formed from special packages of glimmer which read the configuration of your weapon and produce usable ammo for it.</dd>
<dt>Reload</dt>
<dd>A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reloaded property.  A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (if available - character's choice).  The number in the parenthesis is how many shots the weapon can make before the it needs to be reloaded.</dd>
<dt>Two Handed</dt>
<dd>This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.</dd>
<dt>Heavy</dt>
<dd>Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons.  A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.</dd>
<dt>Light</dt>
<dd>A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.  Enables two-weapon fighting.</dd>
<dt>Burst Fire</dt>
<dd>A weapon that has the burst fire property can make a normal, single-target attack, or it can spray a 10-foot cube area within normal range with shots.  Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take the weapon's normal damage.  This action uses 10 pieces of ammunition.</dd>
<dt>Automatic Fire</dt>
<dd>A weapon with the Automatic Fire property can apply burst fire to 10 foot cube areas, spending 10 pieces of ammunition for each area covered, up to the total amount of ammunition loaded.  If you do not have 10 ammunition to spend, you cannot spread your automatic fire to another area.  Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take the weapon's normal damage.</dd>
<dt>Rapid</dt>
<dd>This weapon fires very quickly, and can fire off multiple shots rapidly.  The number in the parenthesis represents the number of times per round that the weapon can be fired.</dd>
<dt>Explosive</dt>
<dd>This weapon fires highly explosive rounds.  The number in the parenthesis is the blast radius.  Every creature in the blast radius that succeeds at a DC 15 Dexterity save takes half of the weapon's damage.</dd>
<dt>Range</dt>
<dd>A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property.  The range lists two numbers.  The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range.  When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disavantage on the attack roll.  You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's range.</dd>
