# Loot
Guardians, in their quest to persevere against the Darkness, will often encounter new equipment and gear.  Most of the time, this gear will drop in the form of a data engram, which must be taken to a member of the Cryptarchs to be decoded.  When the encoding is cracked, the tiny ball of glimmer expands into the item it was intended to be.

## Item Rarity
Items of various quality exist and some may be imbued with incredible properties that make them extremely useful.

### Common
Common items are basic, and appear as described in the tables in the Weapons and Armors sections.

### Uncommon
Uncommon items are of a slightly better quality than normal.  They act as +1 weapons and armor, and may have a modification.  Roll once on the appropriate Modification Table (below) based on the item type.

### Rare
Rare items have a slight quality increase over Uncommon items.  They act as +2 weapons and armor, and may have up to two modifications.  Roll twice on the appropriate Modification Table based on the item type, rerolling for duplicates.

### Legendary
Legendary items, typically remnants of the Golden Age, are instruments of the highest quality.  They act as +3 weapons and armor, and may have up to three modifications.  Roll three times on the appropriate Modification Table based on the item type, rerolling for duplicates.

### Exotic
Exotic items are unique artifacts, carefully crafted to accentuate the traits of a specific warrior (or type of warrior).

While every Exotic item is different, they typically have the same benefits as Legendary items in addition to a special property unique to this item.  Roll three times on the appropriate Modification Table based on the item type, rerolling for duplicates, and once on the Artifact Attributes Table as well.

Unlike other items, Exotic items require attunement.  Attuning to an Exotic item requires a short rest during which you must spend time with the item in question.  What you do during this time is up to you, but it centers around the item.  Cleaning, maintaining, or practicing with the item are all ideal.  You can only attune three Exotic items at any time: one weapon, one armor, and one accessory.  Exotic items may have one or more prerequisites, in which case you must satisfy those prerequisites in order to attune to the item.  If you lose any prerequisite, you are no longer attuned to the item and it ceases to function as anything other than a normal (common level) item.
