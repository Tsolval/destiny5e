# Vehicles

A list of all of the vehicles in the game.

## Guardian Class
<dl>
<dt>Sparrow</dt><dd>The Sparrow is a single-occupant vehicle used by Guardians, primarily for fast travel across long distances within a combat zone. Each Guardian is issued such a vehicle, which is stored aboard their jumpship and can be summoned for use as needed.</dd>
<dt>Jumpship</dt><dd>The Jumpship is a single-occupant vehicle used by Guardians for fast travel between worlds.  Jumpships are equipped with a matter transference device which allows them to pick up and drop off Guardians and equipment without having to risk landing in a combat zone.  These trans-mat devices can deliver non-organic materials from several kilometers, but must be within 30 feet to trans-mat the Guardian.  When not on board, the jumpship can be piloted remotely by the Guardian's ghost.</dd>
<dt>Hawk</dt><dd>The Hawk is a troop carrier VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) aircraft that is used by the Last City. It is typically seen making cargo deliveries at the Tower and is often used by Tower security forces.</dd>

## Fallen Class
<dl>
<dt>Pike</dt><dd>The Pike is a single-occupant hovercraft-like vehicle used by the Fallen. The vehicle has a pair of small Arc guns on either side, near the front, capable of rapid-fire for a short time. Guardians can pilot the vehicle, although the driver will have to be dispatched first.  Pikes have the ability to boost and to barrel roll. This, in combination with their fast speed, make them a nimble and highly maneuverable weapon in a fight.  Unlike Sparrows, the boost will eventually wear out and take a moment to recharge.</dd>
<dt>Heavy Pike</dt><dd>The Heavy Pike is a larger variant of the Pike.  It has a slower rate of fire than the standard Pike, but fires splash-damage rounds.  Also, the Heavy Pike can fire bouncing Shock mines, much like a Skiff. Like the ordinary Pike its boost will eventually run out and requires a moment to recharge. Its armor is significantly stronger than a Sparrow or Pike's.  While an ordinary Pike has only one central engine the Heavy Pike has seven: four upper offset engines, two lower maneuvering engines, and a central, boosting engine.  When boosting, the maneuvering engines will align with the central engine, much like how the Cabal Interceptor's engines align together for a short-term boost.</dd>
<dt>Skiff</dt><dd>Launched from much larger vessels such as Ketches, the Skiff is capable of rapidly deploying infantry and armor, such as the Fallen Walker, into combat zones. They do, however, have armament in the form of twin plasma cannons (which deal Arc damage) and bouncing mines, and as such is used as temporary air support while offloading troops and vehicles.  The cannons fire powerful explosive rounds that deal heavy splash damage and the mines can block off certain areas.  Skiffs are commonly seen sending reinforcements to Fallen-controlled territories, but will also deploy in force into combat zones, such as when mining Glimmer or retrieving a Warsat.</dd>
<dt>Ketch</dt><dd>Ketches are massive starships that are capable of inter-system travel. The Fallen arrived on these ships in the wake of the Collapse, disembarking to pillage the remnants of human civilization.  The Awoken of the Reef also employ Ketches, presumably captured from Fallen foes during the Reef Wars.  A number of Ketches in Reef livery participated in the battle against Oryx's Hive fleet over Saturn.</dd>
