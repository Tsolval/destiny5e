> -- which in the end is just a matter of substrate chauvinism. It doesn't matter if the system thinks with flesh or superconductor or topological braids in doped metallic hydrogen, as long as the logic is the same. And our logic is the same. Yours and mine.
> If I am a machine then so are you. If you are not a machine then neither am I. Exo minds are human. It is incontrovertible.
> You understand? I'm going to take that slack-jawed stare as understanding. 
> Now here's the real question. Why are Exo minds human? What's the design imperative? Why does a war machine - yes, absolutely, I am a war machine, built by human hands; and you are a survival machine built by the engine of evolution. Don't interrupt me.
> Why does a war machine have emotions? Why should a war machine have awareness? These are not useful traits on the battlefield. Don't flatter yourself. They are not useful. So why should the Exo mind mimic the human architecture so closely?
> You know what I smell on you? I smell the stink of anthropocentrism. I think you think that there's only one way to think. That's why the Exo mind is so human, you presume. Because all higher thought converges.
> My friend, you should meet the Vex. There is nothing human in them.
> Now. This is what I believe happened, back in the time before any Exo can remember. It explains everything.
> I think someone wanted to live forever.

# [Exo](http://destiny-grimoire.info/#Card-102140)
_"Ask yourself: what threatened your Golden Age ancestors so much that they constructed the Exos to defend themselves?"_
___
Built for a long-forgotten struggle, Exos are self-aware war machines so advanced that nothing short of a Ghost can understand their inner functions. They remain ciphers, even to themselves: their origins and purpose lost to time.  Whoever built the Exos fashioned them in humanity's image, gifting them with diversity of mind and body. Many of the City's Exo citizens live and work alongside their organic brethren. But others fight again, re-forged in the Light of the Traveler to serve as Guardians.

Exos manufactured bodies are unyielding and tireless, but their minds are completely human.  Many Exo experience a dream they call Deep Stone Crypt, the "place where they were born."  It is described as "the infamous subroutine which seeded the first Exo consciousness."  Cayde-6's memories stretch further, where he recalls being a human before traveling to Europa to become an Exo, as he "came there in flesh and bone. Gave everything to the ice. Started over. Rebooted."


## [Exo Names](http://fantasynamegenerators.com/destiny-exo-names.php)
Exos only have one name.  If they ever had a family name it is lost to the ages.  Every Exo has a number appended to their name. The meaning of this number is unknown, but may possibly signify how many times an Exo has had its memory wiped.  Not all wipes are successful in completely removing past memories, though, especially for Guardians.

## Exo Traits
Your Exo character has a variety of natural Abilities which are bestowed upon them by the nature of their particular evolution.
**Ability Score Increase:** Your Strength, Constitution, and Intelligence scores each increase by 2.
**Age:** An Exo's metal body means that, so long as it is kept in good condition, it will last forever.  These countless years can weigh heavily on a soul, however, so an Exo is occasionally "rebooted" or has her memories wiped.  All known Exos were "born" centuries ago, in the Golden Age, when the technology to create them was still available.
**Alignment:** They may not remember what the threat was, but Exos were built to protect humanity.  Thus they tend toward Lawful Good.
**Size:** Exo generally fall into the same height categories as Humans.  Their metal bodies, are light and strong, but still weigh more than the muscle and bone of a human.  Exos tend toward a bulkier, more powerful appearance. Your size is Medium.
**Speed:** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
**Languages:** You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice.
